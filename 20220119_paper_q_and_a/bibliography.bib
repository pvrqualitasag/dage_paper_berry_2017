  abstract = {Apprehension among consumers is mounting on the efficiency by which
cattle convert feedstuffs into human edible protein and energy as well
as the consequential effects on the environment. Most (genetic) studies
that attempt to address these issues have generally focused on
efficiency metrics defined over a certain time period of an animal's
life cycle, predominantly the period representing the linear phase of
growth. The age at which an animal reaches the carcass specifications
for slaughter, however, is also known to vary between breeds; less is
known on the extent of the within-breed variability in age at slaughter.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to quantify the
phenotypic and genetic variability in the age at which cattle reach a
predefined carcass weight and subcutaneous fat cover. A novel trait,
labeled here as the deviation in age at slaughter (DAGE), was
represented by the unexplained variability from a statistical model,
with age at slaughter as the dependent variable and with the fixed
effects, among others, of carcass weight and fat score (scale 1 to 15
scored by video image analysis of the carcass at slaughter). Variance
components for DAGE were estimated using either a 2-step approach (i.e.,
the DAGE phenotype derived first and then variance components estimated)
or a 1-step approach (i.e., variance components for age at slaughter
estimated directly in a mixed model that included the fixed effects of,
among others, carcass weight and carcass fat score as well as a random
direct additive genetic effect). The raw phenotypic SD in DAGE was 44.2
d. The genetic SD and heritability for DAGE estimated using the 1-step
or 2-step models varied from 14.2 to 15.1 d and from 0.23 to 0.26 (SE
0.02), respectively. Assuming the (genetic) variability in the number of
days from birth to reaching a desired carcass specifications can be
exploited without any associated unfavorable repercussions, considerable
potential exists to improve not only the (feed) efficiency of the animal
and farm system but also the environmental footprint of the system. The
beauty of the approach proposed, relative to strategies that select
directly for the feed intake complex and enteric methane emissions, is
that data on age at slaughter are generally readily available. Of
course, faster gains may potentially be achieved if a dual objective of
improving animal efficiency per day coupled with reduced days to
slaughter was embarked on.},

  abstract = {Clustering, a comparison group defini- tion procedure, set the beginning and end of a group within a herd such that all cows with a similar calving date were in the same comparison group. The proce- dure had two parameters: maximum inter- val length and desired minimum number of observations in a cluster. Variants of clusters were compared with groups with ked seasons (December to April and May to November) and were evaluated according to within-group variance and effective number of daughters. Analyses were done on first lactation records of cows in the Northeast calving between December 1979 and September 1988 (1,280,474 first lactations of five breeds, 10,386 sires) were analyzed. For all clustering variants, the undesirable influ- ence on accuracy of a sire's evaluation from increasing variation within compar- ison group was compensated for by in- creased effective number of daughters. Clustering parameters that yielded com- parison groups with 15 to 40 observations were optimal. Clusters spanning several years may lead to biased evaluations be- cause of a time trend in production. The clustering procedure was implemented in the Northeast AI Multiple Trait Sire and Cow Evaluation. Maximum interval length was 365 d for obtaining a mini- mum of 15 observations in a comparison group.},
